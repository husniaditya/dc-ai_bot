# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing courtesy and professionalism

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Using sexualized language or imagery, or sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (doxing) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces (GitHub issues / discussions, social media, community chats, conferences, etc.).

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers via:
- GitHub: open a confidential Security Advisory (preferred for vulnerabilities)
- Email: security@replace-with-your-domain.example (replace before publishing)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will use these community impact guidelines to determine consequences:
1. Correction – Private, clear guidance
2. Warning – Official warning with consequences for continued behavior
3. Temporary Ban – Temporary removal from interactions
4. Permanent Ban – Permanent removal from community spaces
